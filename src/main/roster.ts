/**
 * The roster on disk — agents, their notes, worktree paths, archived and
 * restorable entries, and parked message queues, stored as one JSON file beside
 * the hive.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. This is the UI floor (cards, notes, queues, worktrees).
 * Hive identity — id, role, cwd, session — lives in `<harnessHome>/hive/registry.json`
 * and is what agents read. The two must not drift: `description` here is the
 * same durable job string as registry `role`, never live status (pause/idle).
 *
 * All of that used to live only in the renderer's localStorage,
 * and localStorage is partitioned by ORIGIN. A dev run loads the renderer from
 * `http://localhost:5173` and a packaged build loads it from `file://`, so the
 * two never see each other's storage: switching between them showed an empty
 * floor and no notes, even though the hive on disk (sessions, memory, inboxes,
 * tasks) was right there and intact. A file keyed on `harnessHome` is shared by
 * both, because it is addressed by path rather than by page origin.
 *
 * localStorage is still written exactly as before. This file is an ADDITION, not
 * a migration away from it — if anything here fails, the renderer falls back to
 * the storage it has always used and nothing is lost.
 *
 * Durability rules, in order of how much they matter:
 *   1. Never lose a roster. Every write first copies the previous file into
 *      `roster-backups/`. Nothing in that folder is ever overwritten, and the
 *      backup on every write stays: it is the cheapest insurance in the app.
 *      The FOLDER is capped, though. It used to be unbounded, which on a busy
 *      floor is thousands of copies a day of a file that changes on every note,
 *      rename, archive and queue move, and it sits under harnessHome so even a
 *      full `app:resetAll` never cleared it. See shared/retention.ts for the
 *      rule: the newest 50 always, plus one per day for the last 30 days.
 *   2. Never write a truncated file. Writes go to a temp file and are renamed
 *      into place, so a crash mid-write leaves the previous file untouched.
 *   3. Never let an empty renderer erase a full roster. See `write`.
