// Theme registry — the pluggable "office theme" contract.
//
// Phase 0 of the TV-show-offices feature (card tvshow-phase0-abstraction):
// extract the ~40% of constants that were hard-coded inside OfficeFloor.tsx
// (errand spots, coffee-economy tile coords, prop anchors, seat names, tileset
// URLs, palette, monitor gids) into a ThemeConfig so the scene becomes
// swappable per show. This phase ships the EXISTING office unchanged as
// `theme: 'office'`: every value below is copied byte-for-byte from the old
// in-file literals, so the office renders and behaves identically.
//
// The engine (TiledMapRenderer / BFS pathfinding / Camera / sprite animation)
// is already fully generic and needs no change. cast.ts is read-only here
// (uncommitted human WIP) — the office theme references its existing exports.
